The github link below includes the following three code samples:

(1) ExampleCleaning.R :
An example R script that was created in order to convert a series of raw datasets into clean.csv, a cleaned panel dataset. The clean data contains the following attributes:
- ID_IPEDS: a unique identifier for each institution
- year: the four-digit academic year, where “2010-11” is coded as 2010, “2011-12” is 2011, and so on
- degree_bach: a dummy variable that identifies bachelor's degree-granting institutions
- public: a dummy variable that identifies public institutions
- enroll_ftug: the total number of first-time, full-time degree/certificate-seeking (henceforth, “FTFT”) undergraduates
- grant_state: total amount of state and local grant aid awarded to FTFT undergraduates
- grant_federal: total amount of federal grant aid awarded to FTFT undergraduates

(2) AnalysisVisualizations.R :
An example R script that was created in order to create a summarative statistics table from a clean.csv file and two time-series graphs.

(3) Multiple_Linear_Regression_to_Predict_Teacher_Attrition_Rates.R :
A sample multiple linear regression run to predict teacher attrition rates in North
Carolina. The dataframe compiled includes sources from the National Center for
Education Statistics, North Carolina Department of Education, and Department for Public
Instruction.

(4) Sentiment Analysis of Survey Measurements of Masculinity.ipynb :
Two sample sentiment analysis algorithms (VADER and RoBERT a) run to analyze the
positive/neutral/negative sentiments of ~500 commonly used survey questions tha
measure masculinity.

(5) "BERT Topic Modeling of Survey Measurements of Masculinity.ipynb": 
A sample topic modeling algorithm (BERT) run to derive and analyze common themes
from ~500 commonly used survey questions that measure masculinity.
